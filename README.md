# with_parcel

Parcel is the up-and-coming module bundler which challenges WebPack. Where Webpack is notoriously difficult to set up and configure, Parcel for the most part simply works. 

> "The cool thing with Parcel is it just figures things out."

This solution is up-to-date and useful in that it uses the new `@use` command to include modules which replaces the `@import` command which is now deprecated. Among other features, the `@use` command enables modules to have namespaces and aliases for these namespaces which is demonstrated in this solution.  

## How to use

- `npm i`
- run Live Server on `index.html`
- `npm run watch` to begin watching and converting scss to css
- make changes to `scss/main.scss` to see them immediately reflected in the browser

## Note

- Webpack is quite powerful and so feel free to use this solution as the base for making a much more sophisticated solution for converting SCSS to CSS, packaging JavaScript files, resizing photos, and packaging and optimizing your website for publishing.
