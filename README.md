# with_gulp

Gulp is a task runner created in 2017 to replace Grunt created in 2012. As a task runner it does much more than convert SCSS to CSS, but in this example all it does is watch one `.scss` file and convert it to a `.css`.

This solution is very simple and should be used mostly as a way to get you up-and-running with a working version of Gulp, and see how Gulp converts SCSS to CSS, or if you merely need to convert one `.scss` file for a small website.

## How to use

- `npm i`
- run Live Server on `index.html`
- `gulp` to begin watching and converting scss to css
- make change to `scss/main.scss` to see it immediately reflected in the browser

## Note

- Gulp is quite powerful and so feel free to use this solution as the base for making a much more sophisticated solution for converting SCSS to CSS, packaging JavaScript files, resizing photos, and packaging and optimizing your website for publishing.
