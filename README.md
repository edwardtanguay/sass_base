# with_parcel

Webpack is a JavaScript module bundler created in 2012. It is still the default website bundler although it notoriously difficult to set up and is therefore being replaced for simpler projects by Parcel.

This solution is very simple and should be used mostly as a way to get you up-and-running with a working version of Website, which itself can be a challenge. Use this solution to see how Webpack converts SCSS to CSS, or if you merely need to convert one `.scss` file for a small website.

## How to use

- `npm i`
- run Live Server on `index.html`
- `npm run watch` to begin watching and converting scss to css
- make changes to `scss/main.scss` to see them immediately reflected in the browser

## Note

- Webpack is quite powerful and so feel free to use this solution as the base for making a much more sophisticated solution for converting SCSS to CSS, packaging JavaScript files, resizing photos, and packaging and optimizing your website for publishing.
