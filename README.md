# with_create_react_app

Using create-react-app and then making a few changes to enable SASS is probably the easiest way to use the full functionality of SASS with modules, plus you are in the rich environment of React which is definitely an advantage.

This solution uses the `sass` library instead of `node-sass` and so can use the `@use` commands which are recommended over the deprecated `@import` command. This solution uses two modules as an example of loading modules.
