# sass_base

This repository has multiple branches which each show a different way to set up SASS in a website in order to automatically convert it to CSS.

## How to use

Switch to the appropriate branch to see the solution to process SASS into CSS.

As a learning guide, the following order is recommended:

- **with_node_sass** - The simplest solution when you only have one `main.scss` file that has to be converted to `main.css`. Uses deprecated `@import` but uses modules and is very straight-forward and pragmatic.

- **with_gulp** - This solution is very simple and should be used mostly as a way to get you up-and-running with a working version of Gulp, and see how Gulp converts SCSS to CSS, or if you merely need to convert one `.scss` file for a small website.

- **with_webpack** - 

- **with_parcel** - 

- **with_create_react_app** -
